  <h2>📜 Letters That Carried the Dream</h2>
  <div class="letter">
  <h3>To Roman Ormandy</h3>
  <p><strong>Dear Roman,</strong></p>
  <p>
    I never met you, but I feel as though I know you—through trueSpace. You didn’t just create a 3D modeling tool. You created a space where imagination could breathe. A place where simplicity met power, and where users felt free to explore without fear.
  </p>
  <p>
    trueSpace was more than software. It was a philosophy. It taught us that creativity should not be locked behind complexity. That beauty could be built with intuition. That even a child could animate a dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to thank you—for your vision, your generosity, and your courage. You gave us something timeless. And even though trueSpace was discontinued, its spirit lives on in every render, every animation, and every person who still remembers.
  </p>
  <p>
    You built a tool. But more than that, you built a community. And this page is my way of saying: we haven’t forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
    With deep respect,<br>
    <strong>Roberto Tracogna</strong><br>

 <div class="letter">
  <h3>To Melinda Gates</h3>
  <p><strong>Dear Melinda,</strong></p>
  <p>
    I write to you as a father, a teacher, and a believer in the power of education. trueSpace was not just a 3D modeling tool—it was a gateway to creativity. It allowed children to build worlds, animate stories, and learn through play. It was simple, intuitive, and free.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a time when digital literacy is essential, tools like trueSpace can make a difference. They can empower young minds to explore, imagine, and create. I ask you to consider the legacy of trueSpace as part of your foundation’s mission. It deserves to be revived—not for profit, but for purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that if children today could use trueSpace with their parents, they would not only learn technology—they would learn to dream. And that, I believe, is the heart of education.
  </p>
  <p>
    With admiration and hope,<br>
    <strong>Roberto Tracogna</strong><br>

  <div class="letter">
  <h3>To Bill Gates</h3>
  <p><strong>Dear Bill,</strong></p>
  <p>
    I write to you not as a technician, nor as a nostalgic user, but as a father and a believer in education. trueSpace was not just software—it was a tool that allowed children to create, animate, and imagine freely. It was simple, intuitive, and powerful. It was a gift.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Microsoft acquired Caligari and discontinued trueSpace, something beautiful was lost. I ask you, with all sincerity, to consider releasing the source code. Let it live again—not for profit, but for education. Let it be a tool for the children of children.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am 71 years old. I have lived through every wave of computing. I have seen tools come and go. But trueSpace was different. It deserves to be remembered. It deserves to be revived.
  </p>
  <p>
    With respect and hope,<br>
    <strong>Roberto Tracogna</strong><br>
